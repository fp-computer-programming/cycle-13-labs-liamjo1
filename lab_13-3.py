# Create a variable, weekdays and set it equal to a tuple that contains the days Monday â€“ Friday as strings.
weekdays = ("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")

# Create a variable weekends and set it equal to a tuple that contains Saturday and Sunday as strings.
weekends = ("Saturday", "Sunday")

# Create a variable called days_of_the_week and set it equal to the concatenation of the two previous variables.
days_of_the_week = weekdays + weekends

# Printing days_of_the_week should display a tuple containing all the days of the week in order.
print("Days of the week:", days_of_the_week)
